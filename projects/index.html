<p>My PhD thesis, titled <em>Vortex Gust Mitigation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</em>, focuses on developing strategies to control the behavior of vehicles when facing severe gusty conditions.<br>
Gusts can occur in a variety of environments, such as during difficult weather conditions, near coasts or mountains, or even in clean air turbulence.</p>

<p>In my research, I explored how to use <strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)</strong> to learn control strategies that stabilize aircraft under such challenging conditions.<br>
DRL enables control policies, modeled as <strong>Artificial Neural Networks</strong>, to be trained through trial and error.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exploration Phase:</strong> The control policy learns about the environment dynamics (the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; of the system).</li>
<li><strong>Optimization Phase:</strong> The policy improves its behavior to manage a specific task.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="flow-modeling">Flow Modeling</h2>
<p>To develop gust mitigation strategies, I needed to model the flow field and its interactions with the aircraft.<br>
The perturbation was modeled as a <strong>vortex</strong>, which is representative of vortical structures often shed from buildings, mountains, or other obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="aerodynamic-models">Aerodynamic Models:</h3>
<p>I worked with two types of flow models:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Medium Fidelity Model:</strong> Home made code, fast to compute but less representative of physical phenomena.</li>
<li><strong>High Fidelity Model:</strong> CFD software, computationally expensive but more accurate in representing system dynamics.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mitigation-methods">Mitigation methods</h2>
<p>I trained control policies to maintain the airfoil&rsquo;s <strong>lift coefficient at zero</strong> when subjected to gust disturbances. This training was carried out using <strong>deep reinforcement learning</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="coupling-deep-reinforcement-learning-with-cfd">Coupling deep reinforcement learning with CFD:</h3>
<p>Integrating DRL algorithms with CFD software required significant effort due to the differences in programming languages used by these systems. To enable effective communication between the two, I implemented <strong>sockets programming</strong>, which facilitated data exchange between the DRL algorithms and the CFD solver.</p>
<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>
<p>The coupling was achieved through a streamlined five-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> The CFD software gathers all the necessary data required by the DRL, such as flow variables and aerodynamic coefficients.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> The data is passed to the algorithm via sockets, functioning as requests in a client-server model.</li>
<li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The DRL algorithm processes the data, optimizing the control policy to address the current task.</li>
<li><strong>Response Transmission:</strong> The updated control instructions are sent back to the CFD software through another socket request.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation Update:</strong> The CFD software advances the simulation step based on the updated control inputs.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="key-design-goals">Key Design Goals</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generality:</strong> The coupling framework was designed to be as general as possible, enabling seamless integration with various simulation setups and DRL algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> By abstracting the communication layer, the framework can be adapted to different CFD solvers and control tasks without extensive modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> The architecture supports users working on diverse problems, allowing them to apply DRL for their specific simulation and control objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>This coupling framework ensures that DRL algorithms and CFD solvers can collaborate effectively, laying the foundation for advanced, data-driven control strategies in fluid dynamics.</p>

<h2 id="estimation-of-perturbations">Estimation of Perturbations</h2>
<p>An essential part of gust mitigation is accurately <strong>detecting and estimating the perturbation</strong> using sensor data. This involves identifying vortex positions and circulations.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution:</h3>
<p>Using <strong>Kalman filters</strong>, I estimated vortex positions and circulations based on pressure data collected from the airfoil’s leading edge.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black contours:</strong> Actual vortices.</li>
<li><strong>Colored contours:</strong> Estimated vortices, with colors representing relative errors in circulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with multiple gust vortices, the model accurately captured vortex positions and circulations as they approached the airfoil.</p>

<h1 id="master-projects">Master Projects</h1>
<h2 id="modeling-of-icing-phenomenon">Modeling of Icing Phenomenon</h2>
<p>This project focused on understanding the physics of ice formation on airplane wings to design an optimized heating system.</p>
<p>Airplanes operate in low-pressure, low-temperature environments, which often causes supercooled water droplets to freeze on the wings. This ice accumulation can lead to a significant loss of lift, posing serious safety risks. To counteract this, airplane wings are equipped with heating systems. However, the current approach relies on over-powering the heating systems to ensure safety, leading to considerable energy wastage.</p>
<p>The objective of this internship project was to model the ice formation process to optimize the heating system, minimizing energy consumption while meeting safety requirements.</p>
<p>I conducted this project at ONERA, the French Aerospace Laboratory, where I was tasked with developing and implementing a model of ice formation on aircraft wings using Python. My contributions included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing Python code to solve the governing equations of ice formation.</li>
<li>Evaluating the influence of various physical phenomena on the process.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="train-shape-optimization">Train Shape Optimization</h2>
<p>This project aimed to reduce the drag coefficient caused by the junction of two coupled high-speed trains. It was a collaborative effort with an engineering consulting firm and the French National Railway Company (SNCF).</p>
<p>Coupled trains are commonly used to meet growing transportation demands. However, the junction region between the trains experiences a recirculation flow, which significantly increases aerodynamic drag.</p>
<p>The goal of this team project was to optimize the geometry of the coupling region by adding thin aerodynamic surfaces to minimize drag.</p>
<p>We modeled the airflow around the junction using computational fluid dynamics softwares and employed optimization algorithms to determine the best dimensions and orientation of the added surfaces. Our results demonstrated that the optimized surface parameters significantly reduced the recirculation zone, leading to a substantial reduction in drag.</p>
