<p>Abstract: How to leverage deep reinforcement learning to solve vortex gust mitigation problems? In
this dissertation, we approach the gust mitigation problem as an optimal control problem,
modeled as a Markov decision process. Deep reinforcement learning is particularly well
suited to solving these problems: first, it allows us to derive control functions regardless
of the complexity of the aerodynamic model; second, the control function adapts to the
fluid’s response to the control. However, for optimal performance, the controller needs to
know in advance the locations and intensities of the unmeasurable gust vortices. Without
this information, its efficiency is decreased. To address this issue, we employ a vortex
estimation technique based on Kalman filters, which estimates the gust vortices using
data from onboard sensors. Additionally, the learned control functions provide valuable
insights into the mechanisms of gust mitigation. We reveal them using force partitioning
techniques. Overall, this dissertation presents data-driven solutions for the dual tasks of
vortex gust detection and mitigation, with a particular focus on understanding the physical
mechanisms involved in these mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes to solve the vortex gust mitigation problem on a 2D, thin flat plate using onboard measurements.
The objective is to solve the discrete-time optimal
P control problem of finding the pitch rate sequence that minimizes
the lift perturbation. The controller is modeled as an artificial neural network and it is trained to minimize J
using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). To be optimal, we show that the controller must take as inputs the
locations and circulations of the gust vortices, but these quantities are not directly observable from the onboard
sensors. We therefore propose to use a Kalman Particle Filter (KPF) to estimate the gust vortices online from the
onboard measurements. The reconstructed input is then used by the controller to calculate the appropriate pitch rate.
We evaluate the performance of this method for gusts composed of one to five vortices. Our results show that (i)
controllers deployed with full knowledge of the vortices are able to mitigate efficiently the lift disturbance induced
by the gusts, (ii) the KPF performs well in reconstructing gusts composed of less than three vortices, but shows
more contrasted results in the reconstruction of gusts composed of more vortices, and (iii) adding a KPF to the
controller recovers a significant part of the performance loss due to the unobservable gust vortices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is intrinsically well
suited for the control of complex non-linear dynamical
systems, as usually encountered in flight dynamics. In
this paper, we study the control of a non-linear determin-
istic pitch control problem for an unmanned aircraft. We
aim to evaluate the variation in performance of a DRL
controller due to incomplete coverage of the observation
space or noisy actuators. Specifically, we show that a par-
tial coverage of the flight domain during the training pro-
cedure impacts the efficiency of the controller, but retains
the desired stability properties for the system. In addition,
we evaluate the robustness of the controller to unmodeled
actuation noise. We show that under limited perturbation
levels, the average efficiency of the controller remains un-
affected. As a basis for comparison, we also evaluate per-
formance gains over a linear quadratic regulator</p>
